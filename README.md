# 📔 Data Structures and Algorithms
This respository contains my solutions to various data structures and algorithms problems.

## Table of Contents
- [Sorting](#-sorting)
- [Running Median](#-running-median)

## 📚 Sorting
 This folder contains implementations of some sorting algorithms.
- Bubble Sort
- Optimized Bubble Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Selection Sort
- Merge Sort (recursive and iterative) 
- Quick Sort (recursive and iterative)

### Overview of the files:
- `main.cpp` contains the main function that runs the sorting algorithms on an array of integers. It is the entry point of the program.
- `sort.h` contains the function prototypes for the sorting algorithms.
- `sort.cpp` contains the implementation of the sorting algorithms.
- `sorting_handler.h` contains the function prototypes for the functions that handle the sorting algorithms.
- `sorting_handler.cpp` contains the implementation of the functions that handle the sorting algorithms.

## 📊 Running Median
 This folder contains an implementation of finding the median from a stream of data.
